REM This script installs R-devel from SVN trunk on Windows.
REM
REM This script assumes you have 'wget' on your path, as it
REM is used to download. You can find a binary here:
REM
REM     https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/wget64.exe 
REM
REM We use SVN to checkout R trunk from SVN.
REM If you need a Windows SVN client, you can download SlikSVN here:
REM
REM     https://sliksvn.com/download/
REM
REM Be sure to place the installed binary directory on your PATH.
REM
REM If you modify the configuration below, be sure to use
REM a directory _within the %USERPROFILE%; ie, your user
REM directory; otherwise you will almost certainly run into
REM very bizarre permission issues on build.

REM - BEGIN CONFIGURATION VARIABLES -
REM ---------------------------------

REM Set to 32 for a 32bit build.
REM TODO Build both in one go.

SET "R_HOME=%ROOT_DIR%\trunk"

REM -------------------------------
REM - END CONFIGURATION VARIABLES -
REM -------------------------------

REM Ensure that some essential tools are on the PATH.
where /Q %WGET% || (
	ECHO wget [%WGET%] not found on PATH; exiting
	exit /b
)

where /Q %SVN% || (
	ECHO svn [%SVN%] not found on PATH; exiting
	exit /b
)

REM Set the current directory.
if not exist "%ROOT_DIR%" (
	mkdir "%ROOT_DIR%"
)
cd "%ROOT_DIR%"
SET "OLDPATH=%PATH%"

REM URI to RTools.exe
SET "RTOOLS_URL=%CRAN%/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools%RTOOLS_VERSION%.exe"
wget -c %RTOOLS_URL%

REM Install Rtools.
SET "RTOOLS_INSTALLER=.\Rtools%RTOOLS_VERSION%.exe"
"%RTOOLS_INSTALLER%" /VERYSILENT

REM Put Rtools on the path.
SET "PATH=%RTOOLS_BIN_DIR%;%PATH%"

REM Download the R sources. Get the latest R-devel sources using SVN.
svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/
cd trunk

REM Copy in the 'extras' for a 64bit build. This includes tcltk
REM plus some other libraries. Note that the R64 directory should
REM have been populated by the RTools installation.
rmdir /S /Q %R_HOME%\Tcl
xcopy /E /Y C:\R64 %R_HOME%\

REM Ensure the temporary directory exists.
if not exist "%TMPDIR%" (
	mkdir "%TMPDIR%"
)

REM Create the binary directories that will eventually
REM be populated ourselves, rather than letting the
REM bundled cygwin toolkit do it. The RTools 'mkdir'
REM apparently can build directories without read
REM permissions, which will cause any attempt to link
REM to DLLs within those folders to fail.
rmdir /S /Q bin
mkdir bin\i386
mkdir bin\x64

REM Move into the root directory for 'Windows' builds.
cd src\gnuwin32

REM Since we're building from source, we need to get Recommended packages.
make rsync-recommended

REM Download external software -- libpng, libgsl, and so on.
make rsync-extsoft

REM Look at MkRules.dist and if settings need to be altered, copy it to
REM MkRules.local and edit the settings there.
if exist MkRules.local (
	rm MkRules.local
)
cp MkRules.dist MkRules.local

REM Don't use MIKTEX.
sed -i 's/^MIKTEX = TRUE//g' MkRules.local

REM Ensure that the make rules are properly set -- need to
REM point to 'extsoft'.
sed -i 's/^# LOCAL_SOFT/LOCAL_SOFT/g' MkRules.local
sed -i 's/^# EXT_LIBS/EXT_LIBS/g' MkRules.local

REM Attempt to fix up permissions before the build.
cacls %R_HOME% /T /E /G BUILTIN\Users:R > NUL
cacls %TMPDIR% /T /E /G BUILTIN\Users:R > NUL

REM Make it!
REM For this part, we ensure only Rtools is on the PATH. This
REM is important as if the wrong command line utilites are picked
REM up things can fail for strange reason. In particular, we
REM _must_ use the Rtools 'sort', _not_ the Windows 'sort', or
REM else we will get strange errors from 'comm' when attempting
REM to compare sorted files. Probably just placing Rtools first
REM on the PATH is sufficient, but this is fine too.
SET "PATH=C:\Rtools\bin"
make distclean

REM Now we should be able to build R + recommended packages.
make WIN=%WIN% all recommended

REM Clean up.
SET "PATH=%OLDPATH%"
cd %OLDDIR%
